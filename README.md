# Elero Cover Control Component for ESPHome

This project tries to integrate Elero Roller Shutter Motors better into ESPHome / Home Assistant than the native cover components. One major advantage is the possibility to use RolTop-J motors that allow the special venting position. 

For other non -J motors, this project isn't really needed, but it doesn't hurt either. The advantage for other electronic (!) Elero motors could be the possiblity to easily get to motor into programming / wireless mode if the toggle switch is also included.

This has been tested with the following motors:

  - Elero RolTop/D
  - Elero RolTop/D+
  - Elero RolTop-J 868
  - Elero RolTop/D 868
  - Elero RolTop/D+ 868
  - Elero RolTop 868
  - Elero RolMotion/D+
  - Elero RolSmart
